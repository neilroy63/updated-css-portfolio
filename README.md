# updated-css-portfolio

This is my updated portfolio page based on purely front-end tech.

It is a demo of my learnings to date. 

## Future improvements 

I have used (& left) placeholder images and text in the project sections as I will update these when I have a more accomplished body of work. 

## Design decisions

I chose not to use CSS Resets (to help with a clean and consistent baseline CSS) but instead opted to manually reset any unfavourable default settings.
